# 2023 300DTD Media Reviews Demo

A simple review site, showing how a **relational DB** can be linked to a **web UI** using **PHP**

The UI is mobile-first and the CSS shows the use of **CSS variables** to define colours, etc. in an organised way.

Users can 'sign-up' for accounts. The system demos the sign-up and login process. The implemented security demos **password salting/hashing** using PHP's built-in functions.

Reviews can be read by all, but users need to sign-in to leave reviews.

The SQL shows examples of summary queries for review counts
